In this video we learn about the core functionality of FlashPunk based on worlds and entities. We also get to some pixel art. In the video, Paint.NET was used - you can use anything you like but you if you're struggling to find something, try out [Paint.NET](http://getpaint.net). Mac users can try [Seashore](http://seashore.sourceforge.net/The_Seashore_Project/About.html) and a completely cross platform solution is [GIMP](http://www.gimp.org/). Of course, Adobe has several expensive solutions as well that you can use if you have access to them.
