In this video we learn how to set up FlashPunk under FlashDevelop to prepare for some awesome game development.

## Links to get Started

*   [Get FlashDevelop](http://www.flashdevelop.org/)
*   [Guide to setting it up](http://useflashpunk.net/getting-started/setting-up-flashdevelop.html)
*   [Get FlashPunk](http://useflashpunk.net)

## Other Operating Systems

Other operating systems are surprisingly restrictive when it comes to developing for Flash. There are a few options, and there will likely be more as this situation gets explored.

*   If you have access to [Adobe FlashBuilder](http://www.adobe.com/products/flash-builder-family.html), you're good to go with that. Unfortunately it isn't free.
*   There's always the option to [run Windows virtually](http://dev.mothteeth.com/2011/10/how-to-install-flashdevelop-on-osx-with-bridge/), but you will need a copy of Windows.
*   And then there are some more vague [tutorials online](http://www.aaronspjut.com/mind/index.php/2006/07/01/actionscript-3-hello-world-using-eclipse-on-os-x/), but they're completly free.

Watch this space as there is a good chance that we'll put a video up on getting setup in a different operating system some time in the future.

If you're having problems, try to contact someone at Decode.
