How can we make software more than just a movie that is the same every time it runs? 
How do we make it interactive? Well, that's where events come into play...

At any point, if you want to code along, just pause the video while the code is in front of you
and start typing. When you play the video, your changes will be erased. Get access to a big
sandbox <a href="/sandbox/" target="_blank">here</a>.

Big thanks to <a href="https://soundcloud.com/nirvanajakujo" target="_blank">nirvanajakujo</a>
