What does it take to program a computer to do something? That's the question we want to answer
in this series of tutorials. First of all, we break down some basics and get into some drawing.

At any point, if you want to code along, just pause the video while the code is in front of you
and start typing. When you play the video, your changes will be erased. Get access to a big
sandbox <a href="/sandbox/" target="_blank">here</a>.
